		1. Which storage classes create variables local to the function containing them? (AUTO)
		
		2. Which storage classes create variables that persist for the duration of the containing program? (STATIC)
		
		3. Which storage class creates variables that can be used across several files? Restricted to just one file? (STATIC and EXTERN)
		
		4. Variables declared in a block or in the parameter list of a function are assumed to be of storage class __AUTO__ unless specified otherwise.
		
		5. The storage-class specifier __REGISTER__ is a recommendation to the compiler to store a variable in one of the computerâ€™s registers.
		
		6. A non-static variable defined outside any block or function is a(n) __EXTERN__ variable.
		
		7. For a local variable in a function to retain its value between calls to the function, it must be declared with the __STATIC__ storage-class specifier.
		
		8. The value stored in the CPU register can always be accessed faster than that stored in memory. (TRUE)
		
		9. A register storage class variable will always be stored in a CPU register. (FALSE)
