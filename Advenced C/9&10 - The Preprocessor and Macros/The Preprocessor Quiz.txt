		A program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program
		
	2. The C preprocessor is the first step of the compiliation process
		TRUE
		
	3. The C preprocessor may have compiler specific features
		TRUE
		
	4. Every preprocessor directive must begin with a  __________.
		pound sign (#)
		
	5. Only __________ characters may appear before a preprocessor directive on a line.
		Whitespace
		
	6. __________ allows a programmer to produce different executables (code) for different platforms.
		Conditional Compilation
		
	7. Which of the following are C preprocessors directives that allow for Conditional Compiliation?
		#ifdef, #define, #endif
		
	8. This preprocessor directive checks whether a constant expression results in a zero or non-zero value.
		#if
		
	9. This preprocessor directive is used to remove the definition of an identifier which was previously defined with #define?
		#undef
		
	10. Write some code that will print out your name if the  identifier MY_NAME is defined
		#ifdef MY_NAME
			printf("My name is Jason\n");
		#endif
		
	11. The __________ and __________ directives allow a program to extend the #if and #ifdef/#ifndef directives to test for multiple cases
		#elif, #else
	
	12. What will be the output of the following program?
			#include <stdio.h>
			#define SWAP
	 
			int main()  {
				int x = 3, y = 5;
				#ifdef SWAP
					x = 5;
					y = 3;
				#endif
			printf("%d, %d", x, y);
			}

		Result: 5, 3
		
	13.What will be the output of the following program?
			#include<stdio.h>
 
			#define TEXT
 
			void main() {
				#ifndef TEXT
					printf("hello");
				#else
					printf("hi");
				#endif
			}
			
		Result: hi
		
	14. This preprocessor directive is used to give additional information to the compiler, beyond which is provided in the language
		#pragma
		
	15. This pragma is used to remove an identifier completely from a program.
		GCC poison
	
	16. The purpose of using the preprocessor directive #error is that ____________
		It causes the preprocessor to report a fatal error
