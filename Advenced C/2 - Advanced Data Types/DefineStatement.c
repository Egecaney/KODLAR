 * #define is a preprocessor directive. 
 * Data defined by the #define macro definition are preprocessed, so that your entire code can use it. 
 * This can free up space and increase compilation times.
 * 
 * const variables are considered variables, and not macro definitions. 
 * 
 * The big advantage of const over #define is type checking. 
 * #defines canâ€™t be type checked, so this can cause problems when trying to determine the data type. 
 * If the variable is, instead, a constant then we can grab the type of the data that is stored in that constant variable.
